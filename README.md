# Longest alternating subsequence

Incomig sequence is like a(1),a(2),a(3),...a(n)
outcome a(l1),a(l2),a(l3),... where l1<l2<l3 and a(l1)<a(l2)>a(l3) or a(l1)>a(l2)<a(l3)

Find subsequense as long as possible

(l1) as small as possible

0<a(k)<1000000000
0<n<1000

income standart input or input.txt
first income n, then a1,a2,..
